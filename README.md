## How to use TOCjs?
### Use the Default Sections

```JavaScript
TOC({
  LOCATIONS: {},
  SCRIPTS: {},
  FUNCTIONS: {}
});
```

#### LOCATIONS: Take Actions When an URL Matches
#### SCRIPTS: Load JavaScript When A Location Matches
#### FUNCTIONS: Run Functions once the right files have loaded (and fail gracefully)

### Create New TOC Sections (And share them with the community!)
#### ELEMENT_LOCATIONS: Take Actions When An Element Exists
#### SHORTCUTS: Combine locations and files into single terms for readability
#### DATA_LOCATIONS: Take Actions When Cookie Data Matches
#### ANALYTICS: Trigger Custom Analytics When Specific Functions Run
#### EXTERNAL_CONTENT: Dynamically Load HTML Content
#### JSON: Dynamically Load JSON Data

### Apply TOCjs in Different Scenarios
#### Organize and Integrate Other Developers' Code (i.e., Legacy Code)
#### Test Your Code Before It Goes "live"
#### Ensure Your Analytics Code is Running on All your Sites' Pages
#### Have another scenario you don't see here? Ask!
